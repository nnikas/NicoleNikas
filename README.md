## Nicole Nikas' Page

Hey, I'm Nicole, I graduated with a Bachelor of Science in Engineering Physics with a focus in Electrical Engineering, and a minor in Computer Science.  I currently support applications at Kaiser Permanente as a Software Engineer for TCS.
 
I am looking for opportunities that will teach me more about the different stages of developing ideas into products. I want to move out of the role of supporting, and into the role of developing, while maintaining the same problem solving mindset that I have in my current role. Ultimately my goal is to grow with a team and contribute to a product I can be proud of.
